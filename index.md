## Reflection Part One

**Date:** Friday, May 13, 2022 <br>
**Name:** Daniel Totev


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started this course, I really did not know what “digital history” means, or rather, I had my own interpretation of it. I assumed that this course will be a web-scraping course in the sense that we would extract data from websites and then prepare it for usage in other ways, such as an API or in a spreadsheet. As a result, I thought that there would be a lot of coding and that coding experience would be beneficial. When I got into the course, I began to understand that “digital history” is not that. From Dr. Graham’s explanation about the course, I learned that this is “a methods course,” and that its goal is to help us figure out when to use “a particular digital approach to historical materials” and to consider “the digital tech in the context of a broader historiography” (Graham). This sounded interesting, and I got curious and excited about what will be covered. When I read that “digital history is a team sport” (Graham), I had to stop and think in what sense it would be a collaborative work. In one of the articles, I found a couple of answers: digital history “is known for being an interdisciplinary field, and “some of the best digital history work also comes from working with colleagues in different disciplines” (Martin 630). Then, I learned that this interdisciplinarity can include three other historical fields, such as “oral history, queer history, and literary history, as potential guides for diversifying the digital history classroom” (630). From the video “Crafting Digital History” featured for this course, I also learned that “crafting digital history is exploring the future of the past.” I found this phrasing thought-provoking. All these statements sounded very intriguing, although they disrupted my initial notion of what digital history is and what this course will be all about. Before getting into the rest of the readings, I decided to find another specific definition of what digital history is. I read online that Hannu Salmi has been acknowledged by scholars to have a good definition, so here it is: “Digital history is an emerging field that draws on digital technology and computational methods. A global enterprise that invites scholars worldwide to join forces, it presents exciting and novel ways we might explore, understand and represent the past” (Salmi). The first statement echoes Dr. Graham’s introductory message, and the second statement relates to digital history being a “team sport,” to the emphasis on interdisciplinarity in Martin’s article, and to “exploring the future of the past” in the video. As a result, I take it that digital history is a collaborative effort, which includes various disciplines. It uses various digital and computation methods and focuses on selecting the best approach to breathe new life into historical documents.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one critical aspect when thinking about digital history is to be aware of “digital silences,” which is a topic on which all the readings touched in one way or another. In the article “Returning Women to the History of Digital History”, digital silence is related to inequity when it comes to women being excluded as contributors from the theories and methods of digital history -- “the history of digital history is a settled one—one that is devoid of women” despite of their direct and significant contributions and leadership roles (Leon). Therefore, Leon insists on questioning the conditions that have contributed to the erasure of women in digital history in order to stop the distorted view of women in that field and to address the disadvantages, biases, and discrimination that they are facing. I found this article interesting as it opened my mind to think critically about what contributions, or cohorts of people, could be underrepresented or erased. It made me think about inequity and inclusiveness. As I move forward with digital history, I will keep these in mind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kimberly Martin’s article echoes Leon’s theme but through the view of digital history pedagogy in Canada. She emphasizes the need to make the digital history classroom a more inclusive environment because not only women are excluded but also projects related to oral, queer, and literary history are missing from the syllabi (622). Thus, digital silences are created in the classroom and in the digital history pedagogy. What I found eye-opening was that teaching oral history “meant that students had to critically engage with their sources, to think ethically about the questions they were asking, and to consider what it meant to put this information online, including conversations about privacy, audience, collaboration, and shared authority” (Martin 631). When I move forward with digital history, I will be taking into consideration all these important aspects, especially privacy and what is ethically appropriate to share or not share in a digital world. These aspects also apply to the field of queer history, which is tied into oral history, as it relates to the life stories of lgbtq2+ people (Martin 632). Martin’s article increased my awareness of digital silences and the need to promote inclusivity and diversity in digital history.  In addition to that, AHR Open Review - ‘History Can Be Open Source: Democratic Dreams and the Rise of Digital History’ - allowed me to experience digital history. Each paragraph was reviewed by peer reviewers with visible comments on the right side.  The emphasis here is on the democratization of history, “on incorporating multiple voices, reaching diverse audiences, and encouraging popular participation in presenting and preserving the past”. This digital essay points out that “we must consciously revise our origin stories to be inclusive of the individuals” who shape digital history. Therefore, it echoes the theme of the previous readings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, the two threads by Amalia Skarlatou Levi focus on #digitalarchives that warn users about #archivalsilences in their contents. I learned that archival silence is when “scholars from various disciplines using different methods explore what, how, and why something is missing from the historical record--and its implications” (Levi). I think such studies are very important, and I can relate them to my experiences. I studied Bulgarian language and literature throughout school just to realize in Grade 11 that women were not represented at all in any of the history that we studied digitally. Now that I think about it, that seems like a purposeful exclusion of women from the heroic Bulgarian past, although I am sure there were many brave women. Moreover, I realized in relation to digital history how important digital archives are. It was insightful to read that “1,300 librarians raced to back up #Ukraine’s #digitalarchives” (Levi). The volunteers “backed up everything from the country’s #historicalrecords and #census #data to children’s poems and basket weaving techniques #Ukraine #libraries #archives #digital” (Levi). I realized how quickly the digital history of a nation can be wiped out during times of war and how extremely important it is to preserve it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, all of these articles changed my initial notion of what digital history is. When I am thinking how I can connect these readings to the To Do tasks covered for this assignment, I can see some specific connections. When we all joined the class on Discord, we jumped into the opportunity to work digitally and to create a digital history for the class via comments that could be accessed by others not only during this course but later. We have democratized our digital history, which is a direct reference to the articles. A big component of Discord is the social space and to have a collaborative work environment, which is similar to the description of digital history as a team sport. Our class members are the team. Also, the Discord environment is open to everyone in this course - there are no exclusions based on any criteria, which is what the articles are advocating. Moreover, when making the choice of what to install as a proper text editor, I engaged in the exploration of tools that are used digitally, so this is how they are related to digital history. My text editor is Atom, and I am wondering how many other students chose the same one, and whether the tool choice could mean that there are other common characteristics between the people in that group. Next, the creation of the Github account allowed me not only to organize my work by using the very clear structure provided by Dr. Graham in his repository example, but also to share digitally my work with him and the teaching assistant. After that, reading the tutorials and Dr. Graham’s comments provided the framework for the digital history exploration and how to engage with others. I was glad to see that inclusivity is a priority through the acknowledgement that everyone has their own level of digital work or experience being “techy,” and that is perfectly fine, which reflects the principles promoted in the readings. I chose the Standard Sequence. In the Markdown, I really wanted to see the preview of what I was writing in the .md file, so I found (CTRL+SHIFT+m)  the command for Mac (Atom). I liked Atom because of the user interface and my familiarity with it. When I set up Github, I did not have any challenges. Something that made everything easier was to use Github desktop. It is very easy to push and pull from local folders and files to Github. I ran into some challenges with permission for installing Miniconda3 and setting up the path for Jupyter, but I have captured the details in my logs which show that I consulted an Apple Support page and an AWS blog that provides tips (“Terminal User Guide”; “After installing”). These installations allowed me to set up myself for my Digital History journey, so they related to everything I covered above. Last but not least, when I followed the tutorials, through the choices I made and the images I used, I started creating my own digital history to be shared with you.

  ## **Reflection Part Two**

**Date:** Friday, May 27, 2022 <br>
**Name:** Daniel Totev


### **DIGH3814: Part 2 - Reflection**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities and readings in Part 2 allowed me to extract data, start wrangling it into shape for asking questions, think critically as new questions emerged while getting online information, and assess history by using digital history methods. For example, the readings prepared me for some of the issues that wrangling data creates and their impact on history. The Wget made it possible to download materials from the web, API allowed me to get every article that mentions a specific word, Excel and RStudio helped me analyze and visualize data using graphs, and writing programs in Python provided the opportunity to obtain all sorts of historical information. This whole process provoked critical thinking for a number of reasons -- for so many materials to appear on the Internet, someone has paid for them to be online and someone has chosen to fund one particular project, or archive, over another. The reasons behind the choices for the data and materials found online, as well as the conscious or unconscious gaps that they create, demonstrate what people value from the past, as articulated by Dr. Graham in the Introduction to Part 2. Therefore, as we pull data onto our own machines, it is worth reflecting on some examples of how data finds its way online and who does the work.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Data Foundry - Data Collections from the National Library of Scotland” Tweet Thread reveals that many teams are involved in getting digital data online. The curators are the ones who select what items need to be digitized, the Rights Team reviews the permissions for the data to be digitised, the Conservation Team ensures that the items can be digitised, the Metadata Team creates the descriptions for the items, and the Development Team pulls together “metadata from multiple systems to package the collections up as complete ‘datasets’”. Because some of the datasets are really big, they are stored in the cloud, while people can download smaller samples, together with the text files. Then, a DOI is assigned to every dataset, which is linked to an URL, and serves as a permanent form of identification for the dataset. This lengthy description shows how many people are doing the work, and that it is a collaborative work, a “team sport,” with dependencies across all parties.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foundry claims that “being open and transparent about the digitisation and data-creation process is very important” to them and that they “include as much information as [they] can about how items have been digitised” (“Data Foundry”). However, there is no explanation related to how the curators select the items to be digitized and what criteria they use, so there seems to be a gap given the claim. I went further - to the web site https://www.nls.uk/ - and there is no information on curation (National Library of Scotland). The featured items are “Family History,” so this points to interest in the past from the perspective of genealogical resources. The other item featured is “Treasures of the National Library of Scotland” as a permanent and free exhibition. Someone on a National level must have chosen this topic as important, as well as the specific items to be digitized. Under “Explore the Treasures,” the featured battle is the Battle of Culloden - no other battles. So, this digital archive seems to serve the national interests of the country and create a source of pride in the citizens. The data has been curated, and things have been inevitably left out. The possible ethical dimensions of this collection are that historical archives can be filtered out based on political agendas or government priorities.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different ethical dimensions when it comes to data. While “Topic Modeling Martha Ballard’s Diary” offers great insights for a linguistically complex text, the question is if this is something we should be doing considering that the author did not intend her text to be consumed like that (Blevins, 2010). Are there any moral boundaries that are crossed? There is another moral dimension when we think about big data in history. By choosing what data to extract and especially how to visualize it, which is what I did for the Tutorials, data becomes capta because the data has been “taken, not given, constructed as an interpretation of the phenomenal world, not inherent in it” (Drucker, 2011). Moreover, the “methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social sciences carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative,” which is the humanistic approach for which Drucker advocates (Drucker). Through the tutorials for this part, I now realize that my data was capta. I encountered the observer-independent approach during the work I did in the “Excel & R” tutorial -- the creation of the “My Publication Year” bar plot. Drucker’s examples are relevant here. She shows how for bar graphs “in statistical graphics, the coordinate lines are always continuous and straight. In humanistic, interpretative, graphics, they might have breaks, repetitions, and curves or dips” (Drucker). Reviewing my bar plot showing the number of articles per publication year, I immediately observed that some bars are out of range from the y-axis, that the x-axis is not at regular intervals for the year, and that the data is skewed. However, I did not think of anything else. Even if these issues are corrected, the bar plot data will still be capta as it is missing the context and the interpretation, as Drucker observes for her bar graphic in Figure 3 of her article. My bar plot focuses only on the number of articles for a given year, and therefore, it conceals what Drucker calls “the interpretative factors that bring the numerics into being, under a guise of graphical legibility” and “violates the very premises of humanistic inquiry” (Drucker). What is missing, for example, is interpretive data of the dip between the number of articles in 1789 and 1794 and any other meaningful segmentation that would show the data in a multidimensional way similar to what Drucker shows in Figure 4.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another ethical dimension emerges when we think about crowdsourcing and the article “Making such bargain: Transcribe Bentham and the quality and cost-effectiveness of crowdsourced transcription’” (Causer et al,, 2018). This paper uses the “award-winning crowdsourced transcription initiative, Transcribe Bentham, which began in 2010” as a case study to answer two questions: first, whether the transcriptions of volunteers do are of high enough quality for scholars to do research based on them, and second “whether crowdsourced transcription makes economic sense” (Causer et al.). Nowhere does this paper mention anything about whether it is acceptable to use free labor for such a project. Although the transcripts are of high standard and it makes economic sense to do it this way with the help of technology, the gap here is that the transcribers’ voice is absent, and the ethical aspect is who is going to benefit from the free labor. The blog “Transcribe Bentham” sheds some light (ULC Home). The blog tells us that this project is “a double award-winning collaborative initiative, which is crowdsourcing the transcription of Bentham’s previously unpublished manuscripts.” While anyone can start transcribing, I went further and did research that shows that it is the Faculty of Laws at University College London that is funding this project with “the principal aim of producing a new critical edition of The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham.” Hence, the institution will likely make profit from the work. Moreover, in this case, again, an institution is funding the project, and one of the reasons why Bentham was chosen is because “in ethics, he provided the classic exposition of the utilitarian theory which has been a major strand in moral philosophy since the eighteenth century” (ULC Home). Why choose to transcribe the works of someone focusing on utilitarian theory as opposed to another theory? Does this point to a gap, to a renewed interest in utilitarianism, or both? Regardless, this shows the specific interest of that particular university and possibly their agenda to get acknowledgement and profit.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second article on Bentham --  “Transcription maximized; expense minimized?” -- which I wanted to read because the abstract refers to answering the question if crowdsourcing is exploitative, points to another topic for reflection, as suggested by Dr. Graham: “What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you?” (Causer et al., 2012). One of the barriers is that resources are sometimes not accessible for my academic institution. For this article, I could only see the abstract, but I could not access the article with my Carleton credentials. Certainly, the mistake can be on my side, but I tried several times. Another barrier, in general, is that a lot of courses use video materials through links that bring students to an external resource, often posted on YouTube. Sometimes, the links are broken as the video has been pulled down or the URL has changed, so digital experiences are not necessarily positive in these cases. The biggest obstacle is that all resources are digital and depend on having an Internet connection. Therefore, I download any materials that are downloadable so that I have them on my machine locally. Without an Internet connection, like right now due to the storm, I am still cut off from any online learning materials.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carleton courses usually provide access to various articles, often in PDF format, that can be accessed for each particular course through the library website, or through the weekly learning modules on Carleton’s Brightspace. PDF is the most popular format for making resources available to students, and it allows for an easy download and a quick opening of the files, provided that the person has a PDF Reader installed. Course slides and syllabi can be viewed directly on Brightspace, with the option to download them. However, for one of my music courses, viewing the files directly within Brightspace resulted in blank screens and missing images, so that was another barrier. For other courses, it is the opposite - when I download the materials, they have missing images or the text layout is problematic.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we study online, we are driven by the digital history machine, but we also act as small contributing wheels to keep that machine moving. Most courses require posting weekly observations on one or more topics.  A lot of courses require responding to the posts of other students, similar to the tweets on various subjects covered for this course. Thus, we build digital history. The collaborative approach associated with digital history is critical. However, it is not necessarily practiced for all courses. For one of my music classes now, there is a barrier to seeing the posts of other students until I post my own observation. This is a collaboration obstacle, inability to build upon others’ ideas, and a missed opportunity to be part of a “team sport”.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, as Carleton students, we do a lot of research, so we dive into the world of digital history. One current example for me is analyzing one of the books “On Architecture” by Vitrivius as a primary source, then doing secondary research on that book, and sharing the paper with the teaching assistant and the professor. I am extracting data, and I am creating digital history to which others contribute by commenting. Now, based on the readings, I am thinking why I chose the Harvard translation of the source, and the answer is easy -- because it is a prestigious university. However, I now know that I made a choice based on assumptions and biases, and I am wondering if a better translation is not out somewhere in the digital world. The important thing to remember is that something is always left out while engaging with history data -- unconsciously or consciously. As students, we occasionally experience a biased approach related to the selection of digital materials. One of my summer courses last year was supposed to cover the history of world religions, but most of the course was focused on one specific religion, the one that the professor promoted and knew most about because of her background. This is when leaving things out comes into play. While I enjoyed learning about this particular religion, I took the course to get a wider knowledge of religion, not focus on a specific one.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job of historians is not easy. While the same is true about digital historians, there are differences with regards to the value of/for regular historians showing their work in contrast to what digital historians have to do. The value of regular historians showing their work is to gain an understanding about what happened in the past and how people lived. For instance, a Roman History historian would study not only specific historical events, but also how the Roman society functioned, what religious or spiritual beliefs it had, how politics worked, and more. The value of regular historians to show their work is to demonstrate that they can see the past through the perspective of the people living at that time and to help us do the same. Historians make conclusions about the past based on the answers to the questions they pose. For example, using my knowledge from a previous history class, one of the questions historians asked was why Hannibal defeated one of the biggest Roman armies in history at the battle of Cannae. By examining the evidence, historians uncovered that Hannibal's effective military tactics allowed him to defeat the Roman army that was almost twice the size of his. Then, they tell the world what these tactics were. I wonder what a digital history approach on this same topic would produce. In addition, regular historians use both primary and secondary sources to gain insights from the past based on facts and materials they consider trustworthy and unbiased, but we still get different “truths” on the same event. They teach us, and we immerse ourselves in a particular time and gain an understanding of the past through the work of a particular historian. The value for them is to be acknowledged for their contribution to history and for contributing to building up historical knowledge about the past.  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the value for digital historians is to use computational tools and methods to break various barriers by doing interpretive analysis that a regular historian does not do. They research, interpret, and visualize historical information in a context that has more dimensions than the context with which regular historians engage. While regular historians use more of a silo approach, digital historians promote collaboration and expect many contributors to participate in crafting digital history. As stated in “Learning Outcome 3” for this course, “digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion” (Graham, 2022). In other words, they create opportunities for a “team sport,” as opposed to participating more in an individual sport like the regular historians.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when it comes to dealing with technology and data, the complexity of the job of digital historians is at the highest level, as it is demonstrated in the two articles by James Baker. Baker’s book is on the making and selling of satirical prints in Britain – mostly London – during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As a digital historian, he constructs and overlays “physical networks (of artists, publishers, customers, advertisers, material suppliers involved in the trade) with representative networks (of places, people, locations found in designs produced by the trade) using ArcGIS (or similar)” (Baker, 2017, “The soft digital history”). This is not part of the work and skillset of a regular historian. Moreover, the mental model of the digital historian is shaped by the process of “abstracting data, normalising those abstractions in preparation for analysis, and making visualisations of those abstractions” (Baker, “The soft digital history”).  The path taken by a regular historian is different as they rarely use ‘abstraction’ and ‘data models’, but digital historians do because “doing digital history creates the conditions in which this abstraction from and modelling of primary sources bubbles to the surface”(Baker, 2017, “The hard digital history”). Digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop new technologies, like the ones for transcription, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion (Baker, “The hard digital history”). Thus, there are big differences between regular and digital historians.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last topic for reflection for Part 2 is related to the scholarly value of showing my work now and how it differs compared to the way I wrote history before this class. Prior to starting this course, research, writing, and visualization of data for me were focused on a specific topic with a very specific goal associated with a course. Writing history was a more lonely activity compared to what I am experiencing now. The reminder that digital history is a “team sport” encourages me to think bigger, to accept what Dr. Graham calls in his notes ‘glorious’ failures, and to get outside of my comfort zone - more specifically to reach out for help and to help others. The biggest shift is that the scholarly value in showing my work now lies in opening up my mind and my work for feedback and collaboration. The result is that I begin to develop the way I write and think about history so that I am more inclusive of others, in addition to being more aware of biases, silences, and absences. Also, I engage with research and writing differently because I think about how data is extracted, why the historical sources are there, what is omitted, why something is published, and what the flaws are of the typical data visualization in our Sciences courses. When showing my work and my thinking, I know that others in this course will have a similar mindset when they respond and we collaborate, and this is motivating.
