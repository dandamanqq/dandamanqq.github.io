## My Quick Static Site

This is a site I build with gh-pages. **Wow**

It reads [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and turns it into html.

**Sequence That You Intend To Follow:** Standard Sequence

#### Name of Tutorial: Basics of Markdown

**Observations:**
I really enjoyed following the instructions on the [Basics of Markdown](https://craftingdh.netlify.app/tutorials/markdown/) page which was provided. It is very cool how creating an md file with markdown tools can be converted to look nice and readable. I had a fun playing around with different Markdown Tools and learned how to do some cool things. I added a table at the bottom of the "markdownConventions.md" file to experiment how hard it would be:

**Things that challenged me:**
One thing that challenged me when doing this task was that I couldn't see the preview of what I was writing in the md file. I researched what can help with this and if there is a way see a preview and there was! I am using a mac so the command is "control-shift-m". Once you type that a second window will open on the right with a preview of that md file. Here is how it looks like:

**Where I went for help:**
This is where I went for help to discover this very helpful preview tick: [Preview Trick - Control-Shift-M](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview#:~:text=Markdown%20Preview%20package,md%20%2C%20.)

#### Name of Tutorial: Github

**Observations:**
I am familiar with using Github so this tutorial went pretty good for me. One thing that really made everything easier was to use Github desktop. This simplifies the development and workflow.

Here is a sample image of what my Github desktop looks like:

**Things that challenged me:**
When setting up Github I did not have any challenges and everything went very smooth sailing. Something that made everything easier and less difficult was to use Github desktop. It is very easy to push and pull from local folders and files to Github.  

**Where I went for help:**
The provided page had everything explained very clearly and I had no difficulty or need for help - [Github.](https://craftingdh.netlify.app/tutorials/github/)

#### Name of Tutorial: Install Python & R

**Observations:**
Since I am a Computer Science major, I already have python installed. I updated python on my computer from the website provided in the tutorial and everything is up to date now:

When installing Jypyter Notebooks, it was successful. I have never heard or used Jupyter Notebooks but when I ran "jupyter notebook" in my terminal and it opened a browser containing the folders and directories on my computer, it was very cool and interesting.

When installing R and R Studio, the installation went great with no challenges.

**Things that challenged me:**
When installing Miniconda3, I had to run with "sudo" due to lack of permissions. I also had to do "chmod +x" to have permission for the installer to run as an executable. I had to drag the downloaded file into the terminal.

When installing Jupyter, it wasn't properly added to my path so I had to route it to the folder that I had made.
I had to use this command: **"~/.local/bin/jupyter-notebook"**.

**Where I went for help:**
This site helped me get figure out using the sudo permission and using "chmod +x" to run as an executable [(Permission).](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/terminal/apdd100908f-06b3-4e63-8a87-32e71241bab4/mac)

When installing Jupyter, this was the site that helped me with my path problem: [(Jupytor)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35313876/after-installing-with-pip-jupyter-command-not-found)

#### Name of Tutorial: Discord
**Observations:**
I am very familiar with Discord and use it all the time.
I have made a post on the "social-chat" on discord:
